# 🌧️ Rainfall-Forecasting ☔

Predict tomorrow’s rain using advanced machine learning on real USA weather data (2024-2025). This project includes data exploration, multiple models (Logistic Regression to XGBoost), hyperparameter tuning, and detailed performance analysis — all to build accurate, reliable rain forecasts.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with rich visualizations  
- Preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Training and evaluating 10+ ML models  
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV  
- Performance comparison via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, and confusion matrices  
- Saving/loading trained models for easy reuse
